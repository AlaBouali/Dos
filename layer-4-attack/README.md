# INSTALLING
all tools don't require any dependencies (except python interpreter) so you can just clone repo to your local machine using this command:
```
git clone https://github.com/AlaBouali/Dos
```
and then go to repo directory using `cd` command and then run any tool of them using python interpreter.
